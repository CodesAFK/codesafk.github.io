My name is Dave, and I *code*.

I’ve always been of the opinion that you shouldn’t respond to someone asking who you are by telling them what you do.  Fortunately for me, what I do is who I am.  I positively love every moment that I spend coding, especially the parts that other people hate.
**I love it when the code breaks**.  If every line worked the first time, there wouldn’t be a reason to do this.  There wouldn’t be a challenge, there wouldn’t be innovation.  What drives innovation more than something that doesn’t work?  That’s the time when you should be the happiest to be a developer.
That’s why they call it development, isn’t it?  Because it can always be: 
<ul>
<li>Better</li>
<li>Cleaner</li>
<li>Faster</li>
<li>Shinier</li>
</ul>
Outside of my love for all things code and in case you’re curious about the man behind the keyboard…

I’m originally from a small town in the American Midwest.  Despite growing up in the “country”, I was different than those around me.  When I was a kid I was indoctrinated to hate the city life.  This had the opposite of the intended effect.  I am a shining example of a country boy who was hypnotized by city lights.  It’s not that I am ashamed of where I came from…  It’s just that I’ve always been more interested in what was in front of me, than what was behind me.  I was (and am) always looking for the next big adventure.  On that note, I’ve learned throughout my travels and adventures, that no one can do it alone.

For me, that someone is my wife.  Without her, I wouldn’t be able to breathe.  Since the first time I met her, she’s been an unstoppable positive influence in my life.  Every time the ship has steered off course, she’s been right there, both with encouragement and accurate course correction instructions.  There has been more than once that she has saved us from certain disaster.  She’s not the **wind beneath my sails**, she’s the captain of the ship.  I love her today, as I loved her the moment I met her, as I shall love her the moment I die.  Together we have 3 kids.  Two girls and a boy.  It has previously occurred to me that this may be a **long-frame** hustle that my wife is running on me.  All of the children will soon surpass me as the second most intelligent person in the house…  It’s all so clear now.

In a past life I was a United States Marine.  That phase lasted about 9 years and a few months.  I don’t mention my time in the Marine Corps very often.  Not because I was involved in black ops, but because I’ve never been **that guy**.  Fun fact:  The justification of your existence should not be predicated upon the accomplishments of your past.  Write that down.

I spend most of my free time in Azeroth (#NotSorry) with fantasies of being the lead tank for <a href="http://www.method.gg" target="_blank">Method</a>.  And yes, I still run an Arms Warrior.  #StillNotSorry  I’ve played Warcraft since it was something called “shareware.”  

Go ahead and check out my other stuff (I promise it’s less boring).
